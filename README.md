Ghostery is a browser extension for detecting and blocking web trackers, ads, widgets, etc. I developed the blocking functionality.

Ghostery was [acquired](http://blog.betteradvertising.com/2010/01/19/better-advertising-acquires-ghostery/) in January 2010 and is no longer open source. This is an old version of the extension. See [http://www.ghostery.com/](http://www.ghostery.com/) for a current version.
